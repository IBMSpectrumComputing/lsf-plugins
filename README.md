## LSF Plugins

This is where LSF Plugins will be located.  Plugins includes elim's, esub's, eexec's, pam module, or any script used to extend LSF.  These plugins, when published should include sufficient documentation to help users use them in production.

We will use the ECL or Apache Licenses for everything.  Feel free to contribute your code provided you can sign off on the DCO form included as a part of this and our other repositories.
